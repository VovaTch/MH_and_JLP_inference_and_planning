LambdaBelief overview:
- Take together a bunch of beliefs
- One geometric measurement updates them all.
- One semantic measurement updates one of them.
- Do I need to separately update Lambda?
- Do statistics over lambda, extract them on call. (Dirichlet?)

* Include planner in Lambda belief?

Hybrid belief:
* Create the following functions:
- Sample continuous ML.
- Sample continuous single (from the GMM).
- Sample discrete ML.
- Sample discrete single (from classifier model).

* Include planner in Hybrid belief?
